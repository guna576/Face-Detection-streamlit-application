A project on Face Detection in a local image from PC and webcam live feed using Haarcascde frontal face classifier. Used OpenCV library for the over operations on the image data and streamlit for building web application. Deployed in Heroku but have issues on webcam from the streamlit side(Streamlit doesnâ€™t currently have any browser-based camera support).
